(1) Debate integrating log4r and automatically loading it.

(2) Need to create a show.updates() function that provides a way to merge new defaults into an existing project generated using an earlier version of ProjectTemplate. Decide on proper name. update.project conflicts with
an existing generic method.

(3) Debate renaming run.tests() to test.project() permanently.

(4) Should we automatically run test.project() during load.project()?

(5) show.updates() won't work on Windows systems.

(6) show.updates() should offer to replace file after noticing a change.

(7) All sample .zip files were corrupt. Need proper samples for testing.

(8) Need sample SPSS and Stata files for testing.
