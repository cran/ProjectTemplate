# Installing ProjectTemplate from CRAN or GitHub

ProjectTemplate v0.1-3 is currently on [CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ProjectTemplate/) and can be installed using a simple call to `install.packages()`:

    install.packages('ProjectTemplate')

If you would like take advantage of changes to this package that are not available in the version on CRAN, please download the contents of the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/johnmyleswhite/ProjectTemplate) and then run,

    R CMD INSTALL ProjectTemplate_*.tar.gz

For inexperienced users, running the bleeding edge version of ProjectTemplate is probably a mistake. It is generally much less stable than the versions that have been released on CRAN and is usually out of sync with the documentation.
