    <h1>ProjectTemplate is Not Meant to Help You Build an R Package</h1>

<p>ProjectTemplate is not designed to help you write R packages. If you're
looking to do that, you should start by looking at the <code>package.skeleton()</code>
function provided by the <code>utils</code> package. In the future, we hope that there
will be better tools for building packages in R, but the ProjectTemplate
team probably won't be building those sort of tools anytime soon.</p>

<p>If it's not clear to you why ProjectTemplate isn't meant to help you write
your own package, here are some important ways in which a statistical analysis
project differs from a package:</p>

<ul>
<li>A project is built around exactly one data set, while a package should work with many different data sets.</li>
<li>A project is something specific: your goal is to learn a specific fact about the world from a specific data set. In contrast, a package should contain general purpose tools for analyzing many different data sets. For example, a package might contain code to perform linear regression, while a project would contain code that performs linear regression on a specific set of variables, such as height and annual income.</li>
</ul>
